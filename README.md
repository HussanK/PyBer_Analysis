# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Project

The purpose of this project was to get used to taking multiple sources of data and merging them together into a data frame that we can then use to extrapolate information needed
for the analysis. We gained more insight into pandas, coming from the merging and grouping of the dataframes. We also build our foundation for matplotlib, a resources which we can
use to plot graphs into a pthyon file. This again can help us create more easily understandable data. Lastly, we learned how to use pivot tables, something we used frequently in 
excel, in the pandas library. This again is adding to our arsenal of tools that we can use to analyze data given to us.

 As shown in the results, you can see that as you get into a more urban type of area that amount of drives goes up, and the total fares earned goes up, but the average fare per 
 ride and per driver go down. This makes sense as more populated areas will have more drivers to serve more people. Also since cities are more compact, there would be less need 
 for people to need to take a ride a longer distance which means higer fares. Conversely as you get to more rural areas, there are smaller populations of people, therefore less
 driver are necessary. Since everything is spread further apart in a rural area, this cause the average fares to go up since drivers would be taking people further distances. 
 
 ## Summary
 
 The three recommendati0ons I would put give to the CEO are, look at the amount of drivers from a different perspection. You should be looking at drivers per population, as even 
 though there are less drivers, there are less people. Another recommadation I'd give is to look at the average cost of fare based on distance then reassess. If there is a
 disparity between driving twenty miles in a rural area versus driving two miles in a urban area this can be adjusted by changing the prices around. Lastly, I would consider 
 implementing a "surge" pricing strategy, this would increase fares in areas where there is very high demand, potentially pulling up the average fare in a urban area where that
 is more likely to occur.
